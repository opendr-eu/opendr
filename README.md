# OpenDR Toolkit
OpenDR Internal Repository


This is the internal repository of [OpenDR Project](https://opendr.eu) that contains the development version of OpenDR toolkit. 
Note that this version is not yet production ready, so this repository is not yet intended to be used for any purpose, since it might contain unstable code that undergoes heavy development. 
The first public version of OpenDR toolkit is scheduled to be released on Dec. 2021.


*OpenDR project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 871449.*
