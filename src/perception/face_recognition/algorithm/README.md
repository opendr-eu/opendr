# OpenDR Face Recognition

This folder contains the FaceEvolve algorithm for face recognition in the OpenDR Toolkit.

## Sources

The algorithms files are copied from [face.evoLVe: High-Performance Face Recognition Library based on PyTorch](
https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch) with minor modifications.

## Added Files
An additional backbone model was added in the `backbone` directory. 

- `backbone/model_mobilenet`: Copied from [Face Recognition in PyTorch](
https://github.com/grib0ed0v/face_recognition.pytorch) and modified to comply with the OpenDR Toolkit functionality.
