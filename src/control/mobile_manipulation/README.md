# OpenDR Mobile Manipulation - Kinematic Feasibility

This folder contains the OpenDR Learner class for mobile manipulation tasks. This method uses reinforcement learning to train an agent that is able to control the base of a wheeled robot to ensure given end-effector motions remain kinematically feasible.

## Sources

The implementation is based on [Learning Kinematic Feasibility for Mobile Manipulation through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05325).
The environment and code are refactored and modularised versions of the [originally published code](https://github.com/robot-learning-freiburg/kinematic-feasibility-rl).
