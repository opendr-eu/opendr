## engine.target Module

The *engine.target* module contains classes representing different types of targets.

### Class engine.target.BaseTarget
Bases: `abc.ABC`

Root BaseTarget class has been created to allow for setting the hierarchy of different targets.
Classes that inherit from BaseTarget can be used either as outputs of an algorithm or as ground
truth annotations, but there is no guarantee that this is always possible, i.e. that both options are possible.

Classes that are only used either for ground truth annotations or algorithm outputs must inherit this class.


### class engine.target.Target
Bases: `engine.target.BaseTarget`

Classes inheriting from the Target class always guarantee that they can be used for both cases, outputs and
ground truth annotations.
Therefore, classes that are only used to provide ground truth annotations
must inherit from BaseTarget instead of Target. To allow representing different types of
targets, this class serves as the basis for the more specialized forms of targets.
All the classes should implement the corresponding setter/getter functions to ensure that the necessary
type checking is performed (if there is no other technical obstacle to this, e.g., negative performance impact).


### class engine.target.Category
Bases: `engine.target.Target`

This target is used for 1-of-K categorization / classification problems.

The [Category](#class_engine.target.Category) class has the following public methods:
#### Category(data, num_classes=None)
Construct a new [Category](#class_engine.target.Category).
- *data* is a class integer or one-dimensional array / tensor of class probabilities.
- *num_classes* is an integer indicating the number of classes.
  Must be specified only if `data` is an integer. Defaults to None.
- *prediction* is an integer indicating the predicted class.



### class engine.target.Keypoint
Bases: `engine.target.Target`

This target is used for keypoint detection in pose estimation, body part detection, etc.
