## gem module

The *gem* module contains the *GemLearner* class, which inherits from the abstract class *Learner*.

### Class GemLearner
Bases: `engine.learners.Learner`

The *GemLearner* class is a multimodal wrapper inspired by DETR [[1]](#detr-paper) object detection algorithm based on the original [DETR implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr).
The fusion methodologies employed in *GemLearner* are explained in GEM article [[2]](#gem-paper).
It can be used to perform object detection on images (inference) and train GEM object detection models.

The [GemLearner](/src/opendr/perception/object_detection_2d/detr/detr_learner.py) class has the following public methods:

#### `GemLearner` constructor
```python
GemLearner(self, model_config_path, dataset_config_path, iters, lr, batch_size, optimizer, backbone, checkpoint_after_iter, checkpoint_load_iter, temp_path, device, threshold, num_classes, panoptic_segmentation)
```

Constructor parameters:
- **model_config_path**: *str, default="OpenDR/src/perception/object_detection_2d/gem/algorithm/config/model_config.yaml"*
  Specifies the path to the config file that contains the additional parameters from the original [DETR implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr).
- **dataset_config_path**: *str, default="OpenDR/src/perception/object_detection_2d/gem/algorithm/config/dataset_config.yaml"*
  The dataset folder structure e.g., image folders and annotation files location are defined here.
- **iters**: *int, default=10*
  Specifies the number of epochs the training should run for.
- **lr**: *float, default=1e-4*
  Specifies the initial learning rate to be used during training.
- **batch_size**: *int, default=1*
  Specifies number of images to be bundled up in a batch during training.
  This heavily affects memory usage, adjust according to your system.
- **optimizer**: *{'sgd', 'adam', 'adamw'}, default='adamw'*
  Specifies the type of optimizer that is used during training.
- **backbone**: *{'resnet50'}, default='resnet50'*
  Specifies the backbone architecture.
  Currently only supports *'resnet50'*.
- **checkpoint_after_iter**: *int, default=0*
  Specifies per how many training iterations a checkpoint should be saved.
  If it is set to 0 no checkpoints will be saved.
- **checkpoint_load_iter**: *int, default=0*
  Specifies which checkpoint should be loaded.
  If it is set to 0, no checkpoints will be loaded.
- **temp_path**: *str, default='temp'*
  Specifies a path where the algorithm looks for pretrained backbone weights, the checkpoints are saved along with the logging files.
- **device**: *{'cpu', 'cuda'}, default='cuda'*
  Specifies the device to be used.
- **threshold**: *float, default=0.7*
  Specifies the threshold for object detection inference.
  An object is detected if the confidence of the output is higher than the specified threshold.
- **num_classes**: *int, default=91*
  Specifies the number of classes of the model.
  The default is 91, since this is the number of classes in the COCO dataset, but modifying the *num_classes* allows the user to train on its own dataset.
  It is also possible to use pretrained DETR models with the specified *num_classes*, since the head of the pretrained model with be modified appropriately.
  An example below demonstrates this.
  In this way, a model that was pretrained on the coco dataset can be finetuned to another dataset.
  Training on other datasets than COCO can be done by defining dataset folder structure details in *dataset_config.yaml* and using corresponding *num_classes*.
- **panoptic_segmentation**: *bool, default=False*
  Specifies whether the model returns, next to bounding boxes, segmentations of objects.
  Currently this feature is not supported in GEM.

#### `GemLearner.fit`
```python

#### Demo and Tutorial

An inference [demo](../../projects/perception/object_detection_2d/gem/inference_demo.py) and
[tutorial](../../projects/perception/object_detection_2d/gem/inference_tutorial.ipynb) are available.

#### Examples

* **Training example:**
  The details of multimodal training and evaluation dataset should be described in the *dataset_config.yaml* file.
  The `batch_size` argument should be adjusted according to available memory.

```python
from opendr.perception.object_detection_2d import GemLearner

learner = GemLearner(iters=1, batch_size=1, num_classes=7)
learner.fit()
```

To load pretrained weights from single modal DETR trained on COCO dataset and save after the training is finished:
```python
from opendr.perception.object_detection_2d.gem.gem_learner import GemLearner

learner = GemLearner(iters=1, batch_size=1, num_classes=7)
learner.download(mode='pretrained_detr')
learner.fit()
learner.save('./saved_models/trained_model')
```

* **Inference and result drawing example on the sample images can be downloaded from OpenDR server, similar to single modal inference in [detr_demo colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/detr/blob/colab/notebooks/detr_demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Jf59UNQ37QhJ).**
	This example shows how to perform inference on sample images and draw the resulting bounding boxes using a gem model that is pretrained on the *RGB-Infrared l515 datset*.

```python
from opendr.perception.object_detection_2d import GemLearner
from opendr.perception.object_detection_2d.gem.algorithm.util.draw import draw
from opendr.engine.data import Image
import cv2

# First we initialize the learner
learner = GemLearner(num_classes=7, device='cuda')
# Next, we download a pretrained model
learner.download(mode='pretrained_gem')
# And some sample images
learner.download(mode='test_data_sample_images')
# We now read the sample images
m1_img = Image.open('temp/sample_images/rgb/2021_04_22_21_35_47_852516.jpg')
m2_img = Image.open('temp/sample_images/aligned_infra/2021_04_22_21_35_47_852516.jpg')
# Perform inference
bounding_box_list, w_sensor1, _ = learner.infer(m1_img, m2_img)
# Visualize the detections
# The blue/green bar shows the weights of the two modalities
# Fully blue means relying purely on the first modality
# Fully green means relying purely on the second modality
cv2.imshow('Detections', draw(m1_img.opencv(), bounding_box_list, w_sensor1))
cv2.waitKey(0)
```
