## gated_recurrent_unit module

The *gated_recurrent_unit* module contains the *GatedRecurrentUnitLearner* class, which inherits from the abstract class *Learner*.
In addition, the module also contains the convenient function to download and construct the AF dataset [[2]](#af), which is an ECG dataset for heart anomaly detection.

### Class GatedRecurrentUnitLearner
Bases: `engine.learners.Learner`

The *GatedRecurrentUnitLearner* class provides the implementation of the Gated Recurrent Unit network for heart anomaly detection [[1]](#gru).
It can also be used to train a time-series classifier.

The [GatedRecurrentUnitLearner](#src.perception.heart_anomaly_detection.gated_recurrent_unit.gated_recurrent_unit_learner.py) class has the following public methods:

#### `GatedRecurrentUnitLearner` constructor
```python
GatedRecurrentUnitLearner(self, in_channels, series_length, n_class, recurrent_unit, lr_scheduler, optimizer, weight_decay, dropout, iters, batch_size, checkpoint_after_iter, checkpoint_load_iter, temp_path, device, test_mode)
```

**Parameters**:

- **in_channels**: *int*\
  Specifies the number of univariate series in the input.
- **series_length**: *int*\
  Specifies length of the input series.
- **n_class**: *int*\
  Specifies the number of target classes.
- **recurrent_unit**: *int, default=512*\
  Specifies the number of units in the recurrent layer.
- **lr_scheduler**: *callable,  default=`opendr.perception.heart_anomaly_detection.gated_recurrent_unit.gated_recurrent_unit_learner.get_cosine_lr_scheduler(2e-4, 1e-5)`*\
  Specifies the function that computes the learning rate, given the total number of epochs `n_epoch` and the current epoch index `epoch_idx`.
  That is, the optimizer uses this function to determine the learning rate at a given epoch index.
  Calling `lr_scheduler(n_epoch, epoch_idx)` should return the corresponding learning rate that should be used for the given epoch index.
  The default `lr_scheduler` implements a schedule that gradually reduces the learning rate from the initial learning rate (`2e-4`) to the final learning rate (`1e-5`) using cosine function.
  In order to use the default cosine learning rate scheduler with different initial and final learning rates, the user can use the convenient method `get_cosine_lr_scheduler(initial_lr, final_lr)` from this module, i.e.,
  `opendr.perception.heart_anomaly_detection.gated_recurrent_unit.gated_recurrent_unit_learner.get_cosine_lr_scheduler`.
  In addition, the convenient method from the same module `get_multiplicative_lr_scheduler(initial_lr, drop_at, multiplication_factor)` allows the user to specify a learning rate schedule that starts with an initial learning rate (`initial_lr`) and reduces the learning rate at certain epochs (specified by the list `drop_at`), using the given `multiplicative_factor`.
- **optimizer**: *{'adam', 'sgd'}, default='adam'*\
  Specifies the name of optimizer.
  If 'sgd' is used, momentum is set to 0.9 and nesterov is set to True.
- **weight_decay**: *float, default=0.0*\
  Specifies the weight decay coefficient.
- **dropout**: *float, default=0.2*\
  Specifies the dropout rate.
- **iters**: *int, default=200*\
  Specifies the number of epochs used to train the model.
- **batch_size**: *int, default=32*\
  Specifies the size of mini-batches.
- **checkpoint_after_iter**: *int, default=1*\
  Specifies the frequency to save checkpoints.
  The default behavior saves checkpoint after every epoch.
- **checkpoint_load_iter**: *int, default=0*\
  Specifies the training iteration to load checkpoint.
  If `checkpoint_load_iter=0`, training is done from scratch.
  If `checkpoint_load_iter=-1`, training is done from the latest checkpoint.
  If `checkpoint_load_iter=k` and `k < iters`, training is done from checkpoint index `k`.
  Note that the latter option is only available if `temp_path` argument is specified.
- **temp_path**: *str, default=''*\
  Specifies path to the temporary directory that will be used to save checkpoints.
  If not empty, this can be used to resume training later from the latest checkpoint.
- **device**: *{'cuda', 'cpu'}, default='cpu'*\
  Specifies the computation device.
- **test_mode**: *bool, default=False*\
  If `test_mode` is True, only a small number of mini-batches is used for each epoch.
  This option enables rapid testing of the code when training on large datasets.

#### `GatedRecurrentUnitLearner.fit`
```python
GatedRecurrentUnitLearner.fit(self, train_set, val_set, test_set, class_weight, logging_path, silent, verbose)
```

This method is used for training the model using the provided train set.
If validation set is provided, it is used to validate the best model weights during the optimization process.
That is, the final model weight is the one that produces the best validation F1 during optimization.
If validation set is not provided, the final model weight is the one that produces the best training F1 during optimization.

Returns a dictionary containing a list of accuracy, precision, recall, f1 measures (dict keys: `"train_cross_entropy"`, `"train_acc"`, `"train_precision"`, `"train_recall"`, `"train_f1"`, `"val_cross_entropy"`, `"val_acc"`, `"val_precision"`, `"val_recall"`, `"val_f1"`, `"test_cross_entropy"`, `"test_acc"`, `"test_precision"`, `"test_recall"`, `"test_f1"`) during the entire optimization process.

```

This method is used to save the current model instance under a given path.
The saved model can be loaded later by calling `GatedRecurrentUnitLearner.load(path)`.
Two files are saved under the given directory path, namely `metadata.json` and `model_weights.pt`.
The former keeps the metadata and the latter keeps the model weights.

This method is used to download pretrained models for the AF dataset given different cross validation fold index.
Pretrained models are available for `series_length=30` and `n_class=4` and `recurrent_unit in [256, 512]`.
The input series must be a univariate series, i.e., `in_channels=1`.

**Parameters**:

- **path**: *str*\
  Directory path to download the model.
  Note that under this path, `metadata.json` and `model_weights.pt` will be downloaded.
  Thus, to download different models, different paths should be given to avoid overwriting previously downloaded model.
  In addition, the downloaded pretrained model weights can be loaded by calling `GatedRecurrentUnitLearner.load(path)` afterward.
- **fold_idx**: *{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}*\
  The index of the cross validation fold.
  The AF dataset was divided into 5 folds and we provide the pretrained models for 5 different cross-validation folds.

  Path to the data file.
  If the given data file does not exist, it will be downloaded from the OpenDR server.
- **fold_idx**: *{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}*\
  The index of the cross validation fold.
  The AF dataset was divided into 5 folds.
- **sample_length**: *int, default=30*\
  The length of each sample (in seconds).
  This value must be at least 30 seconds.
  Note that this value is different from `series_length`, which is equal to `sample_length` multiplied by the sampling rate (3000 Hz).
- **standardize**: *bool, default=True*\
  Specifies whether to standardize the input series.

**Returns**:

- **train_set**: *engine.datasets.DatasetIterator*\
  The training set that is constructed from `engine.datasets.DatasetIterator` that is ready to be used with the `fit()` method.
- **val_set**: *engine.datasets.DatasetIterator*\
  The validation set that is constructed from `engine.datasets.DatasetIterator` that is ready to be used with the `fit()` method.
- **series_length**: *int*\
  The length of each series (the number of elements in each series).
  This is the same parameter that is used in the constructor of `GatedRecurrentUnitLearner`.
- **class_weight**: *list*\
  The weight given to each class, which is inversely proportional to the number of samples in each class.



### Examples

* **Training example using the AF dataset**.
  In this example, we will train a heart anomaly detector using the AF dataset [[2]](#af), which contains single-lead ECG recordings and the class labels that categorize the samples into 4 classes: normal rhythm, atrial fibrillation, alternative rhythm and noise.
  We start by importing the learner and the function used to download and construct the dataset.
  This dataset has been preprocessed according to [[1]](#gru) and splitted into 5-fold cross validation protocol.

  ```python
  from opendr.perception.heart_anomaly_detection import \
    GatedRecurrentUnitLearner, get_cosine_lr_scheduler, get_AF_dataset
  ```

  In order to download and construct the dataset, we will use the convenient function `get_AF_dataset` that has been imported above:

  ```python
  data_file = 'AF.dat'
  fold_idx = 0
  sample_length = 30
  train_set, val_set, series_length, class_weight = get_AF_dataset(data_file, fold_idx, sample_length)
  ```

  In the above snippet, we specify the name of the data file, the index of the cross validation fold and the length of each sample (in seconds).
  Here, we don't specify any absolute path for the data file so it will be downloaded and saved under the name "AF.dat" in the current directory.

  Then, we proceed to construct the learner object that will train the GRU network for 200 epochs starting from the learning rate of `2e-4` and gradually dropping to `1e-5` using a cosine scheduler.

  ```python
  learner = GatedRecurrentUnitLearner(in_channels=1,
                                      series_length=series_length,
                                      n_class=4,
                                      iters=200,
                                      lr_scheduler=get_cosine_lr_scheduler(2e-4, 1e-5))
  ```

  After the learner has been constructed, we can train the learner using the `fit` function.

  ```python
  performance = learner.fit(train_set, val_set, class_weight=class_weight)
  ```

  In the above code, we pass the `class_weight` parameter to the `fit` function because the AF dataset is imbalanced.
  The `fit` function returns `performance`, which is a dictionary that contains the performance measured after each training epoch.

* **Download and evaluate pretrained models for the AF dataset**.
  In this example, we will show how pretrained models for the AF dataset [[2]](#af) can be easily downloaded by a single line of code using the functionality provided in `GatedRecurrentUnitLearner` and evaluate the model on the test set.
  Since the AF dataset is divided into 5 folds, the following code iterates through each data split, downloads the corresponding pretrained model and evaluates on the correposnding validation set.

  ```python
  from opendr.perception.heart_anomaly_detection import \
    GatedRecurrentUnitLearner, get_AF_dataset
  import os

  # data file path
  data_file = 'AF.dat'

  # pretrained models directory
  pretrained_model_dir = 'models'
  if not os.path.exists(pretrained_model_dir):
      os.mkdir(pretrained_model_dir)

  # sample length of 30 seconds
  sample_length = 30

  # iterate through each validation fold
  # download and evaluate pretrained model
  for fold_idx in range(5):
      train_set, val_set, series_length, class_weight = get_AF_dataset(data_file, fold_idx, sample_length)
      learner = GatedRecurrentUnitLearner(in_channels=1,
                                          series_length=series_length,
                                          n_class=4,
                                          recurrent_unit=512)

      # create a sub directory for each pretrained model
      model_path = os.path.join(pretrained_model_dir, 'AF_{}'.format(fold_idx))
      learner.download(model_path, fold_idx)

      # after pretrained model is downloaded to the given path
      # pretrained weights can be loaded with `load()`
      learner.load(model_path)

      # evaluate
      learner.eval(val_set)
  ```
