## activity_recognition module

The *activity_recognition* module contains the *X3DLearner* and *CoX3DLearner* classes, which inherit from the abstract class *Learner*.


### Class X3DLearner
Bases: `engine.learners.Learner`

The *X3DLearner* class is a wrapper of the X3D implementation found in the [SlowFast repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast) [[1]](#x3d).
It is used to train Human Activity Recognition models on RGB video clips and run inference.

X3D is a family of efficient models for video recognition, attaining state-of-the-art performance in offline recognition at multiple accuracy/efficiency trade-offs.

Pretrained X3D models are available [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md).
On [Kinetics-400](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics), they achieve the following 1-clip accuracy:

| Model  | Accuracy |
| :---:  | :------: |
| X3D-XS | 54.68    |
| X3D-S  | 60.88    |
| X3D-M  | 63.84    |
| X3D-L  | 65.93    |

#### `X3DLearner.fit`
```python
X3DLearner.fit(self, dataset, val_dataset, epochs, steps)
```

This method is used for training the algorithm on a train dataset and validating on a val dataset.

Parameters:
  - **dataset**: *Dataset*:
    Training dataset.
  - **val_dataset**: *Dataset, default=None*
    Validation dataset. If none is given, validation steps are skipped.
  - **epochs**: *int, default=None*
    Number of epochs. If none is supplied, self.iters will be used.
  - **steps**: *int, default=None*
    Number of training steps to conduct. If none, this is determined by epochs.


#### `X3DLearner.eval`
```python
X3DLearner.eval(self, dataset, steps)
```
This method is used to evaluate a trained model on an evaluation dataset.
Returns a dictionary containing stats regarding evaluation.
Parameters:
  - **dataset**: *Dataset*
    Dataset on which to evaluate model.
  - **steps**: *int, default=None*
    Number of validation batches to evaluate. If None, all batches are evaluated.


#### `X3DLearner.infer`
```python
X3DLearner.infer(batch)
```

This method is used to perform classification of a video
Returns a list of `engine.target.Category` objects, where each holds a category.

Parameters:
- **batch**: *Union[engine.data.Video, List[engine.data.Video], torch.Tensor]*
  Video or batch of videos.
  The video should have shape (3, T, H, W). If a batch is supplied, its shape should be (B, 3, T, H, W).
  Here, B is the batch size, T is the clip length, and S is the spatial size in pixels.


#### `X3DLearner.save`
```python
X3DLearner.save(self, path)
```

Save model weights and metadata to path.
Provided with the path "/my/path/name" (absolute or relative), it creates the "name" directory, if it does not already
exist. Inside this folder, the model is saved as "model_name.pth" and the metadata file as "name.json".
If the files already exist, their names are versioned with a suffix.

If [`self.optimize`](#X3DLearner.optimize) was run previously, it saves the optimized ONNX model in
a similar fashion with an ".onnx" extension.

Parameters:
- **path**: *str*
  Directory in which to save model weights and meta data.


#### `X3DLearner.load`
```python
X3DLearner.load(self, path)
```

This method is used to load a previously saved model from its saved folder.
Pretrained models from the [X3D model zoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md) can also be loaded using this function.

Parameters:
- **path**: *str*
  Path to metadata file in json format or to weights path.



#### `X3DLearner.optimize`
```python
X3DLearner.optimize(self, do_constant_folding)
```

Optimize model execution. This is acoomplished by saving to the ONNX format and loading the optimized model.

Parameters:
- **do_constant_folding**: *bool, default=False*
  ONNX format optimization.
  If True, the constant-folding optimization is applied to the model during export.
  Constant-folding optimization will replace some of the ops that have all constant inputs, with pre-computed constant nodes.


#### `X3DLearner.download`
```python
X3DLearner.download(self, path, model_names)
```

Download pretrained X3D models to path.

Parameters:
- **path**: *str*
  Local path to save the files.
- **model_names**: *set(str), default={"xs", "s", "m", "l"}*
  Names of the model sizes to download. Available model names are `{"xs", "s", "m", "l"}`


#### Examples

* **Fit model**.

  ```python
  from opendr.perception.activity_recognition import X3DLearner
  from opendr.perception.activity_recognition import KineticsDataset

  learner = X3DLearner(backbone="xs", device="cpu")
  train_ds = KineticsDataset(path="./datasets/kinetics400", frames_per_clip=4, split="train")
  val_ds = KineticsDataset(path="./datasets/kinetics400", frames_per_clip=4, split="val")
  learner.fit(dataset=train_ds, val_dataset=val_ds, logging_path="./logs")
  learner.save('./saved_models/trained_model')
  ```

* **Evaluate model**.

  from opendr.perception.activity_recognition import X3DLearner
  from opendr.perception.activity_recognition import KineticsDataset

  learner = X3DLearner(backbone="xs", device="cpu")
  test_ds = KineticsDataset(path="./datasets/kinetics400", frames_per_clip=4, split="test")
  results = learner.eval(test_ds)  # Dict with accuracy and loss
  ```


* **Download pretrained model weights and initialize.**

  ```python
  from opendr.perception.activity_recognition import X3DLearner
  from pathlib import Path

  weights_path = Path("./weights/")
  X3DLearner.download(path=weights_path, model_names={"xs"})
  assert (weights_path / "x3d_xs.pyth").exists()

### Class CoX3DLearner
Bases: `engine.learners.Learner`

The *CoX3DLearner* class is a wrapper of CoX3D, the Continual version X3D.
It is used to train Human Activity Recognition models on RGB video clips and run inference frame-wise (one image at a time).

Continual networks introduce an alternative computational model, which lets a 3D-CNN (which otherwise must take a video-clip as input) compute outputs frame-by-frame.
This greatly speeds up inference in online-prediction, where predictions are computed for each new input-frame.
CoX3D is fully weight-compatible with pretrained X3D models.

Pretrained X3D models are available [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md).
On [Kinetics-400](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics) using extended temporal window sizes, they achieve the following 1-clip accuracy when running in steady-state:


| Model     | Accuracy |
| :---:     | :------: |
| X3D-S_64  | 67.33    |
| X3D-M_64  | 71.03    |
| X3D-L_64  | 71.61    |
