# Image-based Facial Expression Recognition Demo

This folder contains an implemented demo of image_based_facial_expression_recognition method implemented by [[1]](#1).
The demo framework has three main features:
- Image: recognizes facial expressions in images.
- Video: recognizes facial expressions in videos in a frame-based approach.
- Webcam: connects to a webcam and recognizes facial expressions of the closest face detected by a face detection algorithm.
The demo utilizes OpenCV face detector Haar Cascade [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/990517) for real-time face detection.

#### Running demo
The pretrained models on AffectNet Categorical dataset are provided by [[1]](#1) which can be found [here](https://github.com/siqueira-hc/Efficient-Facial-Feature-Learning-with-Wide-Ensemble-based-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/tree/master/model/ml/trained_models/esr_9).
Please note that the pretrained weights cannot be used for commercial purposes!
To recognize a facial expression in images, run the following command:
```python
python inference_demo.py image -i ./media/jackie.jpg -pre ./pretrained -d -s 2
```  

The argument `image` indicates that the input is an image. The location of the image is specified after `-i` while `-pre` indicates the location of pretrained model weights. `-d` sets the display mode to true and `-s 2` sets the window size to 1440 x 900.
You can also visualize regions in the image relevant for the classification of facial expression by adding `-g` as arguments:
```python
python inference_demo.py image -i 'image_path' -pre 'pretrained_path' -d -s 2 -g
```  
The argument `-g` generates saliency maps with the Grad-CAM algorithm.

To recognize a facial expression in videos, run the following command:
```python
python inference_demo.py video -i 'video_path' -pre 'pretrained_path' -d -f 5 -s 2
```
The argument `video` indicates that the input is a video. The location of the video is specified after `-i`. `-d` sets the display mode to true, `-f` defines the number of frames to be processed, and `-s 2` sets the window size to 1440 x 900.

To recognize a facial expression in images captured from a webcam, run the following command:
```python
python inference_demo.py webcam -pre 'pretrained_path' -d -s 2 
```
The argument `webcam` indicates the framework to capture images from a webcam. `-d` sets the display mode to true, `-s 2` sets the window size to 1440 x 900.

#### List of Arguments
Positional arguments:

- **mode**:\
Select the running mode of the demo which are 'image', 'video' or 'webcam'.
Input values: {image, video, webcam}.

Optional arguments:

- **-h (--help)**:\
Display the help message.

- **-d (--display)**:\
Display a window with the input data on the left and the output data on the right (i.e., detected face, emotions, and affect values).

- **-i (--input)**:\
Define the full path to an image or video.

- **-pre (--pretrained)**:\
Define the full path to pretrained model weights.

- **-s (--size)**:\
Define the size of the window:
1920 x 1080.
1440 x 900.
1024 x 768.
Input values: {1, 2, 3}.

- **-np (--no_plot)**:\
Hide the graph of activation and (un)pleasant values.

- **-c (--cuda)**:\
Run facial expression recognition on GPU.

- **-w (--webcam)**:\
Define the webcam to be used while the framework is running by 'id' when the webcam mode is selected. The default camera is used, if 'id' is not specified.

- **-f (--frames)**:\
Set the number of frames to be processed for each 30 frames. The lower is the number, the faster is the process.

- **-o (--output)**:\
Create and write ESR-9's outputs to a CSV file.
The file is saved in a folder defined by this argument (ex. '-o ./' saves the file with the same name as the input file in the working directory).

- **-g (--gradcam)**:\
Run the grad-CAM algorithm and shows the saliency maps with respect to each convolutional branch.
