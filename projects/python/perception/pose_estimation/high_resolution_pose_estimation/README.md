# High Resolution Pose Estimation

This folder contains sample applications that demonstrate various parts of the functionality provided by the High Resolution Pose Estimation algorithm provided by OpenDR.

More specifically, the applications provided are:

1. demos/inference_demo.py: A tool that demonstrates how to perform inference on a single high resolution image and then draw the detected poses. 
2. demos/eval_demo.py: A tool that demonstrates how to perform evaluation using the High Resolution Pose Estimation algorithm on 720p, 1080p and 1440p datasets. 
3. demos/benchmarking_demo.py: A simple benchmarking tool for measuring the performance of High Resolution Pose Estimation in various platforms.
