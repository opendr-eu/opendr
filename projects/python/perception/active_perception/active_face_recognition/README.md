# ActiveFaceRecognition Demos

This folder contains sample applications that demonstrate various parts of the functionality provided by the ActiveFaceRecognition algorithms provided by OpenDR.

More specifically, the following applications are provided:

1. demos/fit_demo.py: A tool that demonstrates how to perform training using ActiveFaceRecognition
2. demos/eval_demo.py: A tool that demonstrates how to perform evaluation using ActiveFaceRecognition

Please use the `--device cpu` flag for the demos if you are running them on a machine without a CUDA-enabled GPU.
