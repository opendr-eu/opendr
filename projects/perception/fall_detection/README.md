# Fall Detector Demos

This folder contains sample applications that demonstrate various parts of the functionality provided by the Fall Detector algorithms provided by OpenDR.

More specifically, the following applications are provided:

1. demos/eval_demo.py: A tool that demonstrates how to perform evaluation of the Fall Detector algorithm
2. demos/inference_demo.py: A tool that demonstrates how to perform inference on images and then draw the detected poses
3. demos/webcam_demo.py: A simple tool that performs live fall detection using a webcam

Please use the `--device cpu` flag for the demos if you are running them on a machine without a CUDA-enabled GPU.
