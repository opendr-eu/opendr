# Audiovisual Emotion Recognition

This folder contains a sample application for audiovisual emotion recognition from provided audio and video.
Demo can be run as follows:

```python
python3 audiovisual_emotion_recognition_demo.py -input_video input_video.mp4 -input_audio input_audio.wav
```

The tool expects to receive time-matching speech recording as an audio file and frontal face video as a video file input. Example audio and video files can be obtained from [RAVDESS dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.Yl2yNijP1Pa). The data used for training the model is under 'Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24.zip' and 'Video_Speech_Actor_XX.zip' and audio-video pairs for running the demo can be obtained by downloading these files. The RAVDESS dataset is under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
